    permissions:
    contents: read
    pages: write
    id-token: write

    on:
    push:
        branches: ["main"]
    workflow_dispatch: 
    jobs:
    deploy:
        environment:
        name: github-pages
        url: ${{ steps.openscad-deployment.outputs.page_url }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Deploy openscad customizer
            uses: ./
            id: openscad-deployment
